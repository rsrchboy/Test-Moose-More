NAME
    Test::Moose::More - More tools for testing Moose packages

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.023 of Test::Moose::More - released
    January 21, 2014 as part of Test-Moose-More.

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::Moose::More;

        is_class 'Some::Class';
        is_role  'Some::Role';
        has_method_ok 'Some::Class', 'foo';

        # ... etc

DESCRIPTION
    This package contains a number of additional tests that can be employed
    against Moose classes/roles. It is intended to replace Test::Moose in
    your tests, and re-exports any tests that it has and we do not, yet.

FUNCTIONS
  known_sugar
    Returns a list of all the known standard Moose sugar (has, extends,
    etc).

TEST_FUNCTIONS
  meta_ok $thing
    Tests $thing to see if it has a metaclass; $thing may be the class name
    or instance of the class you wish to check.

  does_ok $thing, < $role | \@roles >, [ $message ]
    Checks to see if $thing does the given roles. $thing may be the class
    name or instance of the class you wish to check.

    Note that the message will be taken verbatim unless it contains %s
    somewhere; this will be replaced with the name of the role being tested
    for.

  does_not_ok $thing, < $role | \@roles >, [ $message ]
    Checks to see if $thing does not do the given roles. $thing may be the
    class name or instance of the class you wish to check.

    Note that the message will be taken verbatim unless it contains %s
    somewhere; this will be replaced with the name of the role being tested
    for.

  has_attribute_ok $thing, $attribute_name, [ $message ]
    Checks $thing for an attribute named $attribute_name; $thing may be a
    class name, instance, or role name.

  has_method_ok $thing, @methods
    Queries $thing's metaclass to see if $thing has the methods named in
    @methods.

  requires_method_ok $thing, @methods
    Queries $thing's metaclass to see if $thing requires the methods named
    in @methods.

    Note that this really only makes sense if $thing is a role.

  is_role $thing
    Passes if $thing's metaclass is a Moose::Meta::Role.

  is_class $thing
    Passes if $thing's metaclass is a Moose::Meta::Class.

  is_anon $thing
    Passes if $thing is "anonymous".

  is_not_anon $thing
    Passes if $thing is not "anonymous".

  check_sugar_removed_ok $thing
    Ensures that all the standard Moose sugar is no longer directly callable
    on a given package.

  check_sugar_ok $thing
    Checks and makes sure a class/etc can still do all the standard Moose
    sugar.

  validate_thing
    Runs a bunch of tests against the given $thing, as defined:

        validate_class $thing => (

            attributes => [ ... ],
            methods    => [ ... ],
            isa        => [ ... ],

            # ensures $thing does these roles
            does       => [ ... ],

            # ensures $thing does not do these roles
            does_not   => [ ... ],
        );

    $thing can be the name of a role or class, an object instance, or a
    metaclass.

  validate_role
    The same as validate_thing(), but ensures $thing is a role, and allows
    for additional role-specific tests.

        validate_role $thing => (

            required_methods => [ ... ],

            # ...and all other options from validate_thing()

  validate_class
    The same as validate_thing(), but ensures $thing is a class, and allows
    for additional class-specific tests.

  validate_attribute
    validate_attribute() allows you to test how an attribute looks once
    built and attached to a class.

    Let's say you have an attribute defined like this:

        has foo => (
            traits  => [ 'TestRole' ],
            is      => 'ro',
            isa     => 'Int',
            builder => '_build_foo',
            lazy    => 1,
        );

    You can use validate_attribute() to ensure that it's built out in the
    way you expect:

        validate_attribute TestClass => foo => (
            -does => [ 'TestRole' ],
            -isa  => [ 'Moose::Meta::Attribute' ], # for demonstration's sake
            traits   => [ 'TestRole' ],
            isa      => 'Int',
            does     => 'Bar',
            handles  => { },
            reader   => 'foo',
            builder  => '_build_foo',
            default  => undef,
            init_arg => 'foo',
            lazy     => 1,
            required => undef,
        );

    Not yet documented or tested exhaustively; please see
    t/validate_attribute.t for details at the moment. This test routine is
    likely to change in implementation and scope, with every effort to
    maintain backwards compatibility.

  attribute_options_ok
    Validates that an attribute is set up as expected; like
    validate_attribute(), but only concerns itself with attribute options.

    Not yet documented or tested exhaustively; please see
    t/validate_attribute.t for details at the moment. This test routine is
    likely to change in implementation and scope, with every effort to
    maintain backwards compatibility.
